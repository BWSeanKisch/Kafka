How about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all this nonsense, he thought, but that was something he was unable to do because he was used to sleeping on his right.",

I ought to just try that with my boss; Id get kicked out on the spot. But who knows, maybe that would be the best thing for me. If I didnt have my parents to think about Id have given in my notice a long time ago, Id have gone up to the boss and told him just what I think, tell him everything I would, let him know just what I feel.<br/> Hed fall right off his desk! And its a funny sort of business to be sitting up there at your desk, talking down at your subordinates from up there, especially when you have to go right up close because the boss is hard of hearing.</p><p>Well, theres still some hope; once Ive got the money together to pay off my parents debt to him - another five or six years I suppose - thats definitely what Ill do.</p> <h4>Thats when Ill make the big change</h4><p> First of all though, Ive got to get up, my train leaves at five.</p><p> And he looked over at the alarm clock, ticking on the chest of drawers. -God in Heaven!, he thought. It was half past six and the hands were quietly moving forwards, it was even later than half past, more like quarter to seven. Had the alarm clock not rung? He could see from the bed that it had been set for four oclock as it should have been; it certainly must have rung. Yes, but was it possible to quietly sleep through that furniture-rattling noise? True, he had not slept peacefully, but probably all the more deeply because of that. What should he do now? The next train went at seven; if he were to catch that he would have to rush like mad and the collection of samples was still not packed, and he did not at all feel particularly fresh and lively. And even if he did catch the train he would not avoid his bosss anger as the office assistant would have been there to see the five oclock train go, he would have put in his report about Gregors not being there a long</p>"
